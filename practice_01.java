// why we use java or any programming language?
// we use programming language to take a task to the computer or device as per our reqaurement and machin can perform task 
// computer understand binary language but human are very defecult to giving task to a computer in a binary form so that we can use programming language like java, python, and many more languages.

// what is JDK?
// JDK stand for java development kit it has a developing tools whose are use to develop a code in systamatic form. for example we can write a code in our langunages called english, jdk tranfer the language into computer language called binary language (110011 0001101).
// inside the JDK JRE present, JRE stand for java runtime enviroment it content libraries and toolkits which make the code easy to write, by using java libraries make code easy and short to write.
// inside the JRE JVM are present, JVM stand for java virtual Machine which are use to convert the code the code into binary form and the give systamatic code
